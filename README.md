### Hi there :relaxed:
My name is Tim, and I have a keen interest in Bayesian econometrics, with a particular focus on time series analysis and dynamic latent variable modeling including deep learning techniques. For Bayesian model implementations and estimations, I use Stan and the No-U-Turn Sampler (or NUTS for short).
