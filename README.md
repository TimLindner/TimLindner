### Hi there!
I am a PhD Candidate in Econometrics at Maastricht University, and I have a keen interest in Bayesian dynamic latent variable modeling. Furthermore, I enjoy writing elegant code using R, Python, and Stan.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Consultant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Platinion track. Besides, I am a former pro athlete in the sports of handball.
