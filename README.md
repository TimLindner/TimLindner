### Hi there :sunglasses:
My name is Tim, and I am currently working as a research assistant in econometrics at Maastricht University. I have a keen interest in Bayesian econometrics, with a particular focus on time series analysis and dynamic latent variable modeling. For Bayesian model implementations and estimations, I use Stan and its built-in No-U-Turn Sampler (or NUTS for short) via RStan â€” the R interface to Stan.
