### Hi there
My name is Tim, and I am a Platinion Consultant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). I have a keen interest in Bayesian econometrics, with a particular focus on time series analysis and latent variable modeling, including machine learning and forecasting techniques. Furthermore, I enjoy wirting elegant code with Python and R.
