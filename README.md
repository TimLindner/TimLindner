### Hi there
My name is Tim, and I am a PhD Candidate in Econometrics at Maastricht University. I have a keen interest in Bayesian econometrics, with a particular focus on time series analysis and latent variable modeling. Furthermore, I enjoy writing elegant code using R, Python, and Stan.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Consultant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Platinion track. Moreover, I am a former pro athlete in the sport of handball.
